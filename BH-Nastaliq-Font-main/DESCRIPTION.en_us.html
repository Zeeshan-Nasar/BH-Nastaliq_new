  BH Nastaliq is a contemporary Urdu typeface designed to bring the elegance of traditional calligraphy to modern digital platforms. Rooted in the rich heritage of the Nastaliq script, this font is engineered to balance artistic authenticity with high readability on screens, making it ideal for web publishing, educational materials, and digital interfaces.

  The design features a cascading (vertical) flow characteristic of standard Nastaliq, but with optimized spacing and stroke modulation to ensure clarity at smaller sizes. This makes BH Nastaliq a versatile choice for long-form text, headlines, and branding in Urdu, as well as other languages using the Perso-Arabic script.
